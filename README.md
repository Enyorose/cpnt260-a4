## Some Things I had troubles with
- Some things I had problems with was the hamburger nav, I really need to learn how to make it for mobile first as that seems to be my biggest problem. But I git it to work using the checkbox hack thanks to this video by [KevinPowell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA) it wasn't exactly his work but it was enough to get it working.
- the other thing I can't seem to fix is the background picture, I can't seem to size it for mobile or make it responsive, I probably should have just went with another photo but it looks fine.
- the last thing was my photos on in the figures, but I discovered that was because I was using too much text and because my photos were set to fill 100% when the text elongated so did the photo. so I got rid of some text i didn't need.
